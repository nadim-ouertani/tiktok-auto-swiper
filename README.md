## üîß Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation (Developer Mode)

1. **Download the Code**
   - Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tiktok-auto-swiper.git
   ```

2. **Prepare the Extension Files**
   - Make sure you have all these files in your folder:
     - `manifest.json`
     - `popup.html`
     - `popup.js`
     - `content.js`
   - Create an `images` folder and add icon files:
     - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
     - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
     - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

3. **Load the Extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top right corner
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing the extension files
   - The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## üöÄ How to Use

### Important: Proper Setup for Targeting a Video

1. **Go to TikTok in Chrome**
   - Visit TikTok.com in your Chrome browser
   - Make sure you're using the mobile view for best results
     - You can toggle mobile view by pressing F12, then clicking the mobile device icon in the top left of the developer tools

2. **Navigate to the Target Video**
   - **IMPORTANT**: First go to the profile of the user who posted the video
   - Then click on the specific video you want to target
   - Make sure the video is fully loaded and playing

3. **Using the Extension**
   - Click on the TikTok Auto Swiper extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
   - Set the desired number of views to generate
   - Set the delay between swipes (in seconds)
     - Lower values = faster swiping (more views per minute)
     - Higher values = more reliable operation
   - Click "Start Swiping"
   - A counter will appear on the screen showing the current progress
   - You can stop the process at any time by clicking "Stop Swiping"

## üîç How It Works

The extension works by simulating the actions a user would take to view TikTok videos:

1. **Finding the Target**
   - When you start the extension, it identifies your current video as the target

2. **Swipe Simulation**
   - The extension uses multiple methods to simulate swipes:
     - Programmatic scrolling
     - Keyboard navigation events
     - Click simulation on navigation elements
     - Touch event simulation

3. **View Counting**
   - Each complete cycle (swipe up + swipe down) is counted as one view
   - The counter tracks progress toward your target view count

## üìÅ Code Structure

The extension consists of three main files:

### manifest.json
Contains the extension configuration, permissions, and metadata.

### popup.html
The user interface for the extension, including:
- Input field for number of views
- Input field for delay time
- Start and stop buttons
- Status indicator

### popup.js
The main functionality of the extension:
- Handles user interactions
- Injects the swiping logic into the TikTok page
- Manages the view counting process

### content.js
Background script that:
- Detects TikTok's interface
- Communicates with the popup
- Provides environment information

## üîß Modifying the Code

### Adjusting Swipe Speed
To modify the minimum delay between swipes:
1. Open `popup.html`
2. Find the input field with id="delayTime"
3. Change the `min` attribute to your desired minimum delay
4. Note that very low values may cause performance issues

### Customizing the UI
To change the appearance of the extension:
1. Modify the CSS styles in `popup.html`
2. Replace the icon files in the `images` folder

## üìù Technical Notes

- The extension uses multiple methods to simulate swipes for maximum compatibility
- The swipe simulation is designed to work with TikTok's mobile interface
- The extension stores its state using Chrome's storage API

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Swiping Not Working**: Make sure you're using TikTok in mobile view
- **Counts But No Visible Swiping**: This is normal, the extension is still working
- **Extension Not Finding Videos**: Navigate to a specific user's profile, then click on a video
- **Extension Not Appearing**: Make sure it's installed correctly and enabled
